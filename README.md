## Action Points
- integration & unit tests
- test name to kebab case
- make the file libraries as simple as possible, separate multiple operations in a single file
- in product graphql schema, chance owner type to Account!
- transfrom _id to id via virtuals in mongoose schema
- in create-product, convert the owner to string directly, no need to cast it to buffer
- in dataloader use _id for filtering and use the .equals instead .compare
- in Binary scalar, handle ids that are ObjectId
- in account & product model, override the id. set the id to false in schema and add virtual id with value _id
- in tests, use the account & product service for creating documents instead calling graphql requests
